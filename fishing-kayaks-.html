The ancient Inuit were people who lived on the sea.&nbsp;They migrated from Mongolia to Siberia and then crossed the Bering Strait via frozen land bridges.&nbsp;The Inuit began using&nbsp;kayaks for travel by sea&nbsp;at some point during their migration.&nbsp;The&nbsp;kayaks were made&nbsp;of whale bones, and the skins were attached to the frame.&nbsp;The frames were made from different materials. The Western Inuit used wood while the Eastern Inuit preferred sealskin because it is more natural.

                <p class="content1 "  >  <br>Fishing in a kayak is fun and thrilling, but it's important to have the right equipment. These are the top 10 accessories for fishing kayaks. For watersports enthusiasts, sunglasses are essential. These glasses will protect you from the harsh sunlight. Polarized sunglasses can also help you see fish better through the water. For an added benefit, floatable sunglasses should also be considered. Rheos Coopers floating polarized sunglasses will reduce glare and protect your eyes against the harmful effects of the sun. For fishing in large bodies water, a GPS is vital. A VHF radio, which can be used to locate a lost paddle is also an essential accessory. If you find yourself stuck in an area without any land, its directional capabilities could save your life. If you are going offshore, a bilge pump is also useful. A bilge pump can be a great tool to drain the water from your kayak if you are only fishing in small lakes and ponds.

If you intend to use your kayak for trolling, it is worth purchasing an additional rod holder.</p>

                             <p>From where do kayaks come from?&nbsp;Most likely, the first kayaks were made in Siberia.&nbsp;People who settled Americas came from Siberia and crossed the Berengia land bridge.&nbsp;Their boats were called &quot;qajaq&quot; and &quot;umiak&quot; by the people who sailed them to the arctic areas of North America ten to fifteen thousand years ago.&nbsp;The&nbsp;kayak is a popular recreational&nbsp;boat that&#39;s used all over the globe.&nbsp;Inuit kayaks were developed from the tradition of hunting. The ancient Inuit were people who lived on the sea.&nbsp;They migrated from Mongolia to Siberia and then crossed the Bering Strait via frozen land bridges.&nbsp;The Inuit began using&nbsp;kayaks for travel by sea&nbsp;at some point during their migration.&nbsp;The&nbsp;kayaks were made&nbsp;of whale bones, and the skins were attached to the frame.&nbsp;The frames were made from different materials. The Western Inuit used wood while the Eastern Inuit preferred sealskin because it is more natural.</p>

                             <p>A foam block system is your best option if you don&#39;t have a crossbar.&nbsp;Although there are some drawbacks to this method, the benefits far outweigh them.&nbsp;Foam blocks can be placed on channels that are molded to fit over standard crossbar shapes.&nbsp;The blocks will not move while driving thanks to this.&nbsp;The tie down straps are attached to the crossbar frame and not looping through the passenger compartment.&nbsp;Attaching the kayak to a vehicle is the first step in transporting foam blocks.&nbsp;Next, attach the kayak to the vehicle using four pieces.&nbsp;The kayak should be secured to the roof before you drive, as the foam blocks can shift during driving.&nbsp;Keep the door open, and secure the kayak with a strap or rope.&nbsp;You are now ready to go on your kayaking adventure.</p>
